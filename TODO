==============================================================================
= make fake names in input_arrays.c

Instead of having "NULL" names, make up names using the event type, and the
code number, i.e. abs_41, rel_15



==============================================================================
= check out GDAM HID implementation 

- GDAM has a HID Manager implementation and probably a Linux one too


==============================================================================
= profile [hid] object and usage

- find out how much more CPU the names (btn_?, abs, rel, etc) use over using
  just floats.


==============================================================================
= device selection 

by # (1,2,...), generic name (mouse1, joystick2, tablet3...), or device name
("Trackpad", "Microsoft 5-button Mouse with IntelliEye(TM)", etc.)


==============================================================================
= Report available FF effects

- check against HID Utilities Source/PID.h



==============================================================================
= figure out how to store device ID in obj struct

(in SC_HID.c its locID and cookie)

- it should probably just store the Pd arguments

- this will have to be dealt with when the "mouse0", "joystick2" arguments are
  implemented 


==============================================================================
= pollfn for mouse-like devices

- determine whether using a pollfn is actually better than using a t_clock

- any device that acts like a system mouse can be used with a pollfn, since
  the mouse data will go thru Pd's network port, triggering the pollfn.

- this is probably unnecessary since the t_clock seems to run well at 1ms delay

- at standard block size (64 samples), one block = ~1.5ms


==============================================================================
= function return values

- most functions probably do not need return values

- return (1) seems to be the default on many functions


==============================================================================
= control input messages

- are [poll(, [start(, and [stop( needed?  is 0/1/del# enough?


==============================================================================
=  consistent console output 

void hid_post(const char *format, const char *);


==============================================================================
= event name changes

- make key/button Type btn rather than key (undecided on this one)


==============================================================================
= make [linuxhid] [darwinhid] and [windowshid]

- so much info is lost in the translation to a common event scheme that it
  would be quite handy to have platform-specific objects.  This would give
  access to the entire range of devices supported by HID Manager, Linux input
  events, etc.

- these objects should follow the same conventions as [hid]


==============================================================================
= device 0 gets events for all available devices

- it might be useful to have device #0 open all available devices and output
  the events.


==============================================================================
= figure out whole degree issue

- should degree conversion also change rotation direction and 0 point?  The
  degrees on a compass rotate the opposite direction of radians.  The 0 point
  of a compass is due north, with radians, its right/due east.

- [hid_polar] should take an argument (in degrees?) which specifies where the
  0 is on the circle


==============================================================================
= mapping object ideas

[hid2midi] [midi2hid]

midi value + bend <-> hid
	  - use MIDI pitch and bend data for values in between MIDI notes?

object for Fletcher-Munson Equal-loudness contours 

median average object

[infinitepot] for use with a [knob] or any single axis that could be infinite.

[hid_debounce]

peak finder object

"kalman filters"

Curves!!

______________________________________________________________________________
- BUG: multiple instances pointing to the same device don't have seperate close/free

- closing the device on one instance closing that same device on all other
  instances of [hid]

- deleting that instance also closes the device for all other instances
  pointing to that same device


______________________________________________________________________________
- BUG: on MacOS X, mouse axis data is limited by the screen dimensions

- the axes data stops outputting when the mouse pointer reaches the edge of
  the screen.  Hopefully the HID Manager API will allow raw mouse data
  access.  It must since its used with games.


______________________________________________________________________________
- BUG: getting events from the queue doesn't output a 0 value event when the
  motion stops, so when the mouse stops, the sound keeps playing.

This is probably only a problem on relative axes.

  This will probably have to be implemented on a platform-specific level:  

  - On Darwin/MacOSX, I think that the HIDGetEvent() loop will have to be
    followed by one call to HIDGetElementValue()


______________________________________________________________________________
- BUG: hatswitches on MacOS X output an event without a change in value

Because of the currnently implementation of the conversion of the MacOS X
style event to the Linux style event, an event with a value of zero is output
on the unchanged axis when the hatswitch is moved in along the X or Y axis (as
opposed to diagonally).


______________________________________________________________________________
- BUG: on MacOS X, two keyboard key codes are reported as hatswitches

  abs   abs_hat0x       Button Input, Keyboard Usage 0x39
  abs   abs_hat0y       Button Input, Keyboard Usage 0x39

I am pretty sure this is just a hid_print_element_list() display problem.
